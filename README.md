# handwritten-digits-recognition
This is my final project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class.

The purpose of this project is to learn and explore the field of machine learning, specifically how to use Neural Networks to recognize images of handwritten digits from zero to nine. After I was able to implement the Neural Networks, I ran tests for two different datasets one with images of 20x20 pixels and the other with images of 28x28 pixels. Also, I experimented with different sets of values: regularization parameter, the number of training samples, the number of training iteration, and the number of hidden units.

Languages and Libraries used: Python, NumPy, matplotlib

The result of the experiment is available in this file: [system-report.pdf](system-report.pdf)
